# CIFAR-10 Logistic Regression Classifier

This project involves training and evaluating a logistic regression model on the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/cifar10-python-in-csv/) that has been converted to CSV format. The goal is to classify images based on their pixel values.

## Project Structure

- `train.py`: Script to train the logistic regression model on the CIFAR-10 training dataset. It includes steps for data preprocessing, training/validation set splitting, model training, validation set evaluation, and model saving.
- `eval.py`: Script to evaluate the saved logistic regression model on the CIFAR-10 test dataset. It loads the model, preprocesses the test data, makes predictions, and saves these predictions to a text file.
- `models/`: Directory where the trained logistic regression model (`logistic_regression_model.pkl`) is saved.
- `predictions/`: Directory where the model's predictions on the test set (`logistic_regression.txt`) are stored.
- `dataset/cifar10-csv/`: Contains the CIFAR-10 dataset in CSV format (`train.csv` and `test.csv`). The `download_dataset.sh` script is used to download the dataset.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The project requires Python 3.9+ and the following Python libraries:

- pandas 2.2.1
- scikit-learn 1.4.1.post1
- joblib 1.3.2
- numpy 1.26.4

To install the necessary libraries, use the provided `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Downloading the Dataset

To download the CIFAR-10 dataset in CSV format, navigate to the `dataset` directory and execute the `download_dataset.sh` script:

```bash
cd dataset && ./download_dataset.sh
```

### Training the Model

Run `train.py` to train and save the logistic regression model:

```bash
python train.py
```

This script preprocesses the training data, trains the model, evaluates it on the validation set, and saves the model in the `models/` directory.

### Evaluating the Model

To evaluate the saved model on the test dataset, execute:

```bash
python eval.py
```

This script loads the trained model, preprocesses the test data, makes predictions, and saves those predictions in the `predictions/` directory as `logistic_regression.txt`.

## Notes

- Ensure the CIFAR-10 CSV dataset are properly placed in the `dataset/cifar10-csv/` directory before running the scripts.
- Adjust the `header` parameter in the `pd.read_csv()` function within the scripts as necessary, depending on whether your CSV files include header rows.

## Automating Training and Evaluation with ProActive

The `submit2proactive.py` script facilitates the submission of the CIFAR-10 logistic regression training and evaluation pipeline as a job to the ProActive scheduler. This approach allows for leveraging distributed computing resources, thereby potentially accelerating the training process and enabling more efficient model evaluation.

### Script Overview

- `submit2proactive.py`: Automates the submission of the logistic regression model training and evaluation tasks as a ProActive job. The script sets up a job comprising tasks that encapsulate the execution of `train.py` and `eval.py`, handling dependencies and environment setup seamlessly.

### Key Features

- Sets up a ProActive job with distinct tasks for training and evaluation.
- Utilizes Docker to configure a consistent runtime environment across distributed resources.
- Manages file dependencies, ensuring necessary datasets and requirements are available for tasks.
- Employs pre-scripts for environment preparation, such as installing dependencies and setting up datasets.
- Demonstrates the use of ProActive's data management capabilities to handle input and output files effectively.

## Installing the Proactive Python SDK

To install the latest pre-release or development version of the Proactive Python SDK, which includes the most recent features and fixes, use the following command:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --pre proactive
```

The `--pre` flag is included to allow pip to find and install pre-releases.

Ensure your Python environment is set up correctly and you're using Python 3.6 or later. The ProActive Python Client and its documentation are available on the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/ow2-proactive/proactive-python-client).

### Usage

To use the `submit2proactive.py` script, ensure that the ProActive scheduler is accessible and that you have the ProActive Python client set up. Run the script from the project root directory:

```bash
python submit2proactive.py
```
